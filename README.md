# Saviour

Saviour is an emergency tool that is very powerful, in times of real juncture. Saviour can do radio signalings like the popular SOS signal or any emergency signaling. If one gets stuck in a deserted area, say on an island or some mountain, where the Mobile gets useless, due to no network coverage, radios are still there, which can be a very effective way of communication in that scenario, and still, they are used all way. 
Saviour uses Morse Code signaling via a radio transmitter, also with a LED. It also has an OLED display, that can translate any sentence to its Morse Code, and display that code on the OLED simultaneously transmitting the code over the air, and also flashing it via a LED. It also has a buzzer to sound, how the Code will sound.
Now, it also contains a GPS that can get your direct coordinates. Since GPS satellites revolve all around the world, they can connect and get your current location. So with that not only Savior can send the SOS signal using radio, but Saviour sends the location details i.e. the latitude and longitude of the signal's origin location using the GPS. This will make it a lot easier for the search party to find the lost individual thus speeding up the process of the rescue operation.
This hack is not only a very important tool that will come in handy for people going on a vacation or traveling because of work purposes but it can also be used as an educational tool for learning Morse code since it has a Morse Code translator.
